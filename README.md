## What is Coshion? 
Coshion is a pioneering clothing rental application that forms a bridge between clothing store owners, fashion brands, and private individuals eager to rent out their wardrobe selections. Our platform offers users the unique opportunity to rent a diverse range of attire, from the latest styles to vintage finds. The essence of Coshion lies in promoting sustainability by significantly reducing the consumption of fast fashion. We champion the reuse of garments, thereby extending the lifecycle of clothes and creating a circular fashion economy.
